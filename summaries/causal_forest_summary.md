# Causal Forest (EconML)

**ATE (Allergy â†’ Severe AE):** -0.0209  

## Interpretation
- Causal Forest uses machine learning to flexibly adjust for covariates.
- This model estimates **individual-level treatment effects** (heterogeneous effect).
- If ATE is positive and significant, allergy increases severe AE risk, possibly more for certain patient subgroups.

## Causal Forest Results

- The Causal Forest sprouted a lush garden of insights, with an ATE of -0.0209 blooming from the data! Individual effects vary like leaves in the wind, revealing heterogeneous impacts of allergies on severe AEs for TAK.
