## Interpretation: Age Distribution and Severe AE Risk

This interactive histogram compares the **age distribution** of patients who experienced **severe adverse events (AEs)** vs. those who did not.

### Key Observations:

- The **green bars** (non-severe) span a broad age range, while the **orange bars** (severe) peak in **younger age bins**.
- The **box marginal** on top reveals:
  - **Lower median age** for severe AE group
  - **More tightly packed IQR**, indicating younger clustering
- The **distribution overlap** suggests partial age dependence, but not fully exclusive.

### Conclusion:

- Age is a **contributing factor** in AE severity risk, particularly **in patients under 30**.
- This visual reinforces the need for stratified AE monitoring by age.
