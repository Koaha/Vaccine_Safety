## Interpretation: AE Rate by Severity Score

This bar plot shows the proportion of **severe AEs** as a function of the **AE severity score**, which is derived from symptom weighting.

### Key Observations:

- A **clear positive trend**: as severity score increases, the probability of a severe AE rises.
- Scores above **2.5 show a sharp jump**, indicating a non-linear threshold behavior.
- Highest severity scores correspond to nearly **100% chance of being classified as severe**.

### Conclusion:

- The AE severity score is a **strong risk stratifier**.
- Monitoring score distributions can help flag cases for early intervention.
