## Interpretation: Time to Onset by Recovery Outcome

This boxplot visualizes how **onset timing** (in hours post-vaccination) relates to different **clinical recovery outcomes**.

### Key Observations:

- **Poor outcomes** like *Death* and *Ongoing* have **shorter median onset times**, often clustering near the lower quartile.
- **Full recovery** cases are more widely spread, with **higher medians and larger IQR**, indicating more delayed symptom onset.
- **Outliers** (dots beyond whiskers) appear more frequently in the *Ongoing* group, showing variability in atypical cases.

### Conclusion:

- **Faster onset of symptoms** is strongly associated with **worse clinical prognosis**.
- Onset time may be a useful **prognostic marker** for early triage and intervention.
