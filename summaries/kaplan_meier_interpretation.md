# Kaplan-Meier Curve Report for TAK Vaccine Safety

![Kaplan-Meier Curve](../plots/kaplan_meier.png)

## Detailed Interpretation
**X Axis:** Time to onset in hours.

**Y Axis:** Probability of no severe AE (1 to 0).

**Trends Observed:** Steep drops early indicate quick AEs; flattening suggests low late risk.

**Conclusions:** For TAK, if curve drops sharply initially, it concludes most severe AEs occur soon after vaccination, observing median time for half probability.
