## Interpretation of Feature Pairplot
Axes show pairwise features like age (x/y) vs time_to_onset for TAK data.

**Trends:** Severe cases (orange) cluster in lower time_to_onset, shorter durations.

**Observations:**: KDE diagonals show bimodal age for non-severe, unimodal for severe.

**Conclusions:** Short onset and duration signal severity in TAK; predictive for risk assessment.
