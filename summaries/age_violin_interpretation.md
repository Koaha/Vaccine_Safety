# Age Distribution Violin Plot Report for TAK Vaccine Safety

![Age Violin Plot](../plots/age_violin.png)

## Detailed Interpretation
**X Axis:** Has Severe AE categories (0 for no, 1 for yes).
**Y Axis:** Age in years.
**Trends Observed:** The shape shows density; wider areas have more cases. Inner quartiles highlight medians and spreads.
**Conclusions:** If the '1' violin is narrower or shifted lower, it suggests severe AEs are more common in younger groups for TAK. This can conclude age as a moderator for vaccine safety.
