## Interpretation of Age Violin Plot
The x-axis shows severe AE status, y-axis age distribution for TAK vaccine recipients.

**Trends:** Wider violins at younger ages for severe cases indicate higher density.

**Observations:**: Median age lower for severe AEs, with outliers in elderly.

**Conclusions:** TAK may pose higher severity risk in younger groups; further stratification needed.
