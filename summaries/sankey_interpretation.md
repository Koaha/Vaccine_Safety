## Interpretation of Sankey Diagram
Nodes: Left - Symptoms (e.g., phu_niem), Right - Outcomes (e.g., Full recovery).
Flows: Thickness shows case count from symptom to outcome.
Trends: Thicker flows from 'noi_ban' to 'Full recovery' indicate common mild reactions.
Observations: 'kho_tho' has flows to 'Ongoing', suggesting prolonged issues.
Conclusions: For TAK, symptom-outcome paths highlight key risks; conclude that local symptoms resolve well, systemic ones less so.
