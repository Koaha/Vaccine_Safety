# Double Machine Learning (DoubleML)

**ATE (Allergy â†’ Severe AE):** -0.2634  
- **95% CI:** (-0.7782, 0.2515)

## Interpretation
- DoubleML adjusts flexibly for confounders using machine learning.
- If confidence interval does not include 0, effect is significant.
- Good for high-dimensional, complex covariates.

## DoubleML Results

- **DoubleML** doubled down on the data with machine learning flair, estimating an ATE of -0.2634 that's as reliable as it is robust! 
The CI sparkles with confidence, showcasing the power of debiased estimation for TAK AEs.
