# Causal Inference Results (TAK Vaccine Safety)

## Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
- **ATE (Allergy → Severe AE):** 0.0500

## TMLE
- **ATE (Allergy → Severe AE):** nan

## Bayesian Update
- **Final Posterior Probability:** 0.0220

## Practical Recommendations
- If both PSM and TMLE suggest elevated risk, clinical vigilance is recommended for allergic patients.
- Bayesian updates enable continual safety monitoring as more data accumulate.
