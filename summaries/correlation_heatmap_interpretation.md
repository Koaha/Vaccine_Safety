## Interpretation of Correlation Heatmap
This heatmap shows Pearson correlations between numerical features and the target 'has_severe_AE' for the TAK vaccine.
The x and y axes label the features, with the color bar indicating correlation strength (red positive, blue negative).
Trends: Positive correlations with onset_hour suggest delayed symptoms may correlate with severity.
Observations: Age shows low correlation, indicating uniform risk across ages.
Conclusions: Focus on high-correlation features like timing_after_immunization for TAK safety monitoring.
