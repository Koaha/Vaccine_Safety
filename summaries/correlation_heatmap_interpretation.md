# Correlation Heatmap Report for TAK Vaccine Safety

![Correlation Heatmap](../plots/correlation_heatmap.png)

## Detailed Interpretation
**X and Y Axes:** Both axes list numerical features like age, onset_hour, and the target has_severe_AE.
**Color Scale:** Red shades indicate positive correlations (features move together), blue for negative (opposite movement).
**Trends Observed:** Look for cells with has_severe_AE; high positive values suggest risk factors (e.g., low age correlating with higher AE).
**Conclusions:** If time_to_onset shows negative correlation, it implies quicker onset for severe cases. Overall, the heatmap highlights key associations for TAK vaccine safety, aiding in identifying potential risk indicators.
